### 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to design, build, and simulate a realistic enterprise-grade cyber range that mirrors a small-to-mid-sized organization. The environment is designed to include common infrastructure components—such as a domain controller, email server, client workstations, and security monitoring systems—and is used to simulate adversarial attack scenarios from initial access to data exfiltration. The goal is to enable hands-on learning in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations by integrating open-source tools like Wazuh, Security Onion, Sysmon, and Kali Linux.

### 📌 Expected Outcomes

- Develop and deploy a **functional virtual enterprise network** that mimics real-world business infrastructure.
- Successfully simulate core enterprise components, including:
    - 📧 **Email Server**
    - 🖥️ **Workstations (Windows & Linux)**
    - 🛡️ **Security Server**
    - 📊 **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), etc.**
- Gain hands-on experience in **setting up a business IT environment**, including domain services, endpoint systems, and internal communications.
- Understand and simulate the **end-to-end stages of a cyber attack**, from initial access to full compromise, using offensive security tools and techniques.
- Implement and validate **effective security detections and monitoring**, enhancing defensive capabilities using tools like Wazuh and Security Onion.
